      <description>The Problem The need to automate the generation of reports and keep the information updated from our database to the dialer.
The Solution I was the developer in charge of building a workflow so that the dialer administrators could manage the dialer information with the client&amp;rsquo;s database. For example, when a new agent is created on the customer&amp;rsquo;s system, access to the dialer will also be created.
To keep the information in our reports always updated, I created services so that the dialer could make requests to us with the information of the call and in this way be able to save it in the customer&amp;rsquo;s database.</description>
