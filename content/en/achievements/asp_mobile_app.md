## The Problem

The clients of the water and sewerage company Aguas de San Pedro need a way to know the status of their efforts, the current balance of their account and to be able to send messages to the customer service offices.

## The Solution

As a university intern in Aguas de San Pedro I saw the opportunity to create a [cross-platform application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asp.aspconsulta) so that clients could consult their account information whenever they wanted.

Sections were added so that customers could learn about the projects that the company was carrying out in the community. A section was also created so that clients could see the contact information for Aguas de San Pedro.

## Technology Used

- Ionic
