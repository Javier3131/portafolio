## The Problem

The need to automate the generation of reports and keep the information updated from our database to the dialer.

## The Solution

I was the developer in charge of building a workflow so that the dialer administrators could manage the dialer information with the client's database. For example, when a new agent is created on the customer's system, access to the dialer will also be created.

To keep the information in our reports always updated, I created services so that the dialer could make requests to us with the information of the call and in this way be able to save it in the customer's database.
